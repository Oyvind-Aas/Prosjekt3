
We have in this project examined the NMF algorithm and many of its qualities. It has (lossy) compression capabilities which is very useful in saving large amounts of data, at the cost of some lost information in the matrices. The smaller the W and H matrices are, the more compressed the data becomes, at the cost of less accurate data, as we can see in the task 2f. Furthermore, we can see that the NMF has denoicing capabilities from our testing thoughout task $3$, of how the vectors (accecories in the case of Crypto-punks) becomes less noicy and as such the resulting reconstruction becomes less noicy. As expected, the larger the dimentions of the W and H - matrices are, the more accurate the reconstruction becomes compared to the non-noicy images, but only up to a certain point. For our dataset, we see that when $d=256$ that the method becomes overfitted, and even more so for $d=512$, which makes our choise of compression dimentions quite important when running the NMF when encountering noice in the dataset.
