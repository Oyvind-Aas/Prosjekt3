We observe that most of the images are well constructed, as almost all of the images are indeed recognizable and most of the faces keep thir individual looks, traits and accessories. One thing we do observe is "noice" om all of the reconstricted faces: their skin tones aren't consistent, with multiple pixels deviating somewhat from the original skintones. Other than that, we observe that there is a significant loss of sharper and unqiue colors. Specifically, once bright and sharp eye-paint has faded significantly, unique eye, nose and lip-color fade alot as well. But the most significant is the unique skin tones. While the "normal" skin colors such as white, fair, and darker stay mostly consistent, one with green suit as well as the green zombies have totally lost their skin tones, as well as their bright red eyes. 
It seems that the most average qualities get well reconstructed as well as individual "vectors", but unique colors in general areas such as the eyes, nose, mouth and skin tones gets lost.
