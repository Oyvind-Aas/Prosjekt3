We see that the results yield a face with no discernable features. It is clear that the common feature for all the CryptoPunks is the shape of the face, as well as the general area for eyes, nose and lips. We also see some noise around the head, which must be a result of the different vectors (accessories) of the punks. 
We can from the plotted image observe that there are many pixels that has no opacity around the head, specifically in the corners. This must be a result of the fact that none of the image has anything in those areas. This gives us valuable information of the rank of the matrix containing this image. 
If $A$ is a matrix, then $rank(A)$ is equal to the number of leading variables in the general solution of $A\textbf{x}=\textbf{0}$. Because of this, the rank of a matrix cannot exeed the amount of zero columns in the matrix. We know that the matrices are $24\times24$, and we can from the mean image see that there are $3$ zero columns, so the rank of the matrix must be lower or equal to 21.
