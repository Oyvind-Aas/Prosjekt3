In this task we will examine the denoising properties of the NMF algorithm. To do this, we'll artifically create "noicy" images and put them though the NMF algorithm. Then we'll observe the output and how these images compare. Specifically, we'll examine the columns of W to see the atributes of the "vectors" and the noice in them, and them compare different values of $d$ in the NMF algorithm.
