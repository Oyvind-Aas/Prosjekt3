# Project 3 Industrial Mathematics

In this project we investigate Non-negative Matrix factorization (NMF). 
First we consider some mathematical aspects of the numerical algorithm proposed by Lee and Seung. 
We will apply the algorithm on some simple matrices, to inevstigate how it works and some of it's properties.
Secondly, we look at the decomposition of a CryptoPunk image set through the NMF and how this can be used to 
determine the set's most important features. Lastly, we investigate how the algorithm can be used to denoise images.
Here we also explore how a choice of the decomposition size ($d$) can result in either overfitting or 
underfitting the reconstructed images.
